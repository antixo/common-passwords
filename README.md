# Description
This Git repository contains a .txt file with a collection of 40,000 words. The words are stored as plain text, with each word on a separate line. The words are not sorted or filtered in any particular way, and may include duplicates or common stop words.

This repository is intended to be used as a resource for language processing, machine learning, registration on websites, or data analysis projects that require a large vocabulary or word corpus. The .txt file can be easily imported into Python, R, or other programming languages for further analysis or manipulation.

# Usage

You can also get the raw link, and use HTTPS requests from your code. You can use standard file I/O commands to read the words into a list or array, or use specialized libraries or packages for natural language processing or data analysis.

Note that the words.txt file is provided as-is, and no guarantees are made regarding its accuracy, completeness, or suitability for any particular purpose. You are free to use the words in any way you see fit.
